        Pacific salmon live in the northern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of North America and Asia. There are five
        subspecies of Pacific salmon, with an average weight of 10 to 30 pounds. Pacific salmon are born in the fall in
        freshwater stream gravel beds, where they incubate through the winter and emerge as inch-long fish. They live
        for a year or two in streams or lakes and then head downstream to the ocean. There they live for a few years,
        before heading back upstream to their exact place of birth to spawn and then die.Pacific salmon live in the northern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of North America and Asia. There are five
