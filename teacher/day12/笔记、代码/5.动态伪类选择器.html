        I would like to acknowledge everyone who has worked to make CSS what it is today
        and all those who have helped improve diversity and inclusion in tech.
        I would like to recognize those who work tirelessly with browser vendors and devel‐
        opers in writing the CSS specifications. Without the members of the CSS Working
        Group—past, current, and future—we would have no specifications, no standards,
        and no cross-browser compatibility. I am in awe of the thought process that goes into
        every CSS property and value added to, and omitted from, the specification. People
        like Tab Atkins, Elika Emitad, Dave Baron, Léonie Watson, and Greg Whitworth not
        only work on the specification, but also take their time to answer questions and
        explain nuances to the broader CSS public, notably me.
        I also want to acknowledge all those who, whether they participate in the CSS Work‐
        ing Group or not, dive deep into CSS features and help translate the spec for the rest
        of us, including Sarah Drasner, Val Head, Sara Souidan, Chris Coyier, Jen Simmons,
        and Rachel Andrew. In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank people who creat

        CSS was first proposed in 1994, just as the web was beginning to really catch on. At
        the time, browsers gave all sorts of styling power to the user—the presentation prefer‐
        ences in Mosaic, for example, permitted all manner of font family, size, and color to
        be defined by the user on a per-element basis. None of this was available to document
        authors; all they could do was mark a piece of content as a paragraph, as a heading of
        some level, as preformatted text, or one of a handful of other element types. If a user
        configured his browser to make all level-one headings tiny and pink and all level-six
        headings huge and red, well, that was his lookout.
        It was into this milieu that CSS was introduced. Its goal was to provide a simple,
        declarative styling language that was flexible for authors and, most importantly, pro‐
        vided styling power to authors and users alike. By means of the “cascade,” these styles
        could be combined and prioritized so that both authors and readers had a say—
        though readers always had the last say.
        Work quickly advanced, and by late 1996, CSS1 was finished. While the newly estab‐
        lished CSS Working Group moved forward with CSS2, browsers struggled to imple‐
        ment CSS1 in an interoperable way. Although each piece of CSS was fairly simple on

        You may have noticed that there are a lotof values, only three of which I’ve even
        come close to mentioning: block, inline, and list-item. Most of these values will
        be dealt with elsewhere in the book; for example, gridand inline-gridwill be cov‐
        ered in a separate chapter about grid layout, and the table-related values are all cov‐
        ered in a chapter on CSS table layout.
